# Hello, I'm Yayan Li 👋

## About Me
I am a passionate autonomous systems student currently focusing on **self-driving** technologies, **distributed system controls** and **path palnning**. I love working on projects that involve machine learning, robotics, and automation.

## Technologies and Skills
- 🖥️ Programming: Python, C++, Matlab
- 🧠 Machine Learning: PyTorch
- 🚗 Autonomous Systems: ROS, OpenCV

## Featured Projects
### [Control-and-Simulate-Multiple-Robots-in-a-Warehouse-Scenario](https://github.com/Aynlai/Control-and-Simulate-Multiple-Robots-in-a-Warehouse-Scenario)
This project simulates multiple differential drive robots in a warehouse using MATLAB's Simulink and Robotics System Toolbox. The robots perform path planning and avoid collisions. They are coordinated to work together for tasks like package delivery.

### [A-Quadruped-Robot-Development-with-DOGZILLA-12DoF-RPi5-Lidar](https://github.com/Aynlai/A-Quadruped-Robot-Development-with-DOGZILLA-12DoF-RPi5-Lidar)
This project focuses on developing and controlling a 12-DOF quadruped robot, DOGZILLA, using Raspberry Pi5 and ROS2. It covers SLAM navigation, motion control, and AI-based pattern recognition via OpenCV.
